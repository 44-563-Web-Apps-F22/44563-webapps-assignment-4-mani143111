    <h4> ACT I 

        A Utopian Palm Grove</h4>

    <p>Calynx:   Good news!  Great news!  His Majesty's eldest daughter,
        Princess Zara, who left our shores five years since to go to
        England—the greatest, the most powerful, the wisest country
        in the world—has taken a high degree at Girton, and is on
        her way home again, having achieved a complete mastery over all
        the elements that have tended to raise that glorious country to
        her present preeminent position among civilized nations! </p>
      
       <p> Salata:   Then in a few months Utopia may hope to be completely
        Anglicized?</p>
      
        <p>Calynx:   Absolutely and without a doubt.</p>
      
        <p>Melene:   (lazily)  We are very well as we are.  Life without a
        care—every want supplied by a kind and fatherly monarch,
        who, despot though he be, has no other thought than to make his
        people happy—what have we to gain by the great change that
        is in store for us?</p>
      
        <p>Salata:   What have we to gain?  English institutions, English
        tastes, and oh, English fashions!</p>
      
        <p>Calynx:   England has made herself what she is because, in that
        favored land, every one has to think for himself.  Here we have
        no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all our wants,
        and our political opinions are formed for us by the journals to
        which we subscribe.  Oh, think how much more brilliant this
        dialogue would have been, if we had been accustomed to exercise
        our reflective powers!  They say that in England the conversation
        of the very meanest is a coruscation of impromptu epigram!</p>
      
        (Enter Tarara in a great rage)
      
        <p>Tarara:   Lalabalele talala!  Callabale lalabalica falahle!</p>
      
        <p>Calynx:   (horrified)  Stop—stop, I beg!  (All the ladies
        close their ears.)</p>
      
        <p>Tarara:   Callamalala galalate!  Caritalla lalabalee kallalale
        poo!</p>
      
        <p>Ladies:   Oh, stop him!  stop him!</p>
      
       <p>Calynx:   My lord, I'm surprised at you.  Are you not aware that
        His Majesty, in his despotic acquiescence with the emphatic wish
        of his people, has ordered that the Utopian language shall be
        banished from his court, and that all communications shall
        henceforward be made in the English tongue?</p>
      
        <p>Tarara:   Yes, I'm perfectly aware of it, although—(suddenly
        presenting an explosive "cracker").  Stop—allow me.</p>
      
        <p>Calynx:   (pulls it).  Now, what's that for?</p>
      
        <p>Tarara:   Why, I've recently been appointed Public Exploder to His
        Majesty, and as I'm constitutionally nervous, I must accustom
        myself by degrees to the startling nature of my duties. Thank you.
        I was about to say that although, as Public Exploder, I am next in
        succession to the throne, I nevertheless do my best to fall in
        with the royal decree.  But when I am overmastered by an indignant
        sense of overwhelming wrong, as I am now, I slip into my native
        tongue without knowing it.  I am told that in the language of that
        great and pure nation, strong expressions do not exist, consequently
        when I want to let off steam I have no alternative but to
        say, "Lalabalele molola lililah kallalale poo!"</p>
      
        <p>Calynx:   But what is your grievance?
      
        Tarara:   This—by our Constitution we are governed by a
        Despot who, although in theory absolute—is, in practice,
        nothing of the kind—being watched day and night by two Wise
        Men whose duty it is, on his very first lapse from political or
        social propriety, to denounce him to me, the Public Exploder, and
        it then becomes my duty to blow up His Majesty with
        dynamite—allow me.  (Presenting a cracker which Calynx
        pulls.)  Thank you—and, as some compensation to my wounded
        feelings, I reign in his stead.</p>
        <p>Scaphio:  Phantis, you are not in your customary exuberant
  spirits. What is wrong?</p>

  <p>Phantis:  Scaphio, I think you once told me that you have never
  loved?</p>

    Two loving hearts and those that bear them
May join in temporary tether,
    Though Fate apart should rudely tear them.
