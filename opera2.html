        <p class ="speech"> Nay, Luiz, it may not be.  I
            have embraced you for the last time.</p>

        <h6 class="Luiz name">Luiz</h6>
        <p class="speech">Know his story?  Why, I have often told you that my
            mother was the nurse to whose charge he was entrusted!</p>

        <h6 class="casilda name">casilda</h6>
        <p class="speech">True.  I had forgotten.  Well, he has been discovered,
            and my father has brought me here to claim his hand.
          </p>

        <h6 class="Luiz name">Luiz</h6>
        <p class="speech">But you will not recognize this marriage?  It took
            place when you were too young to understand its import.</p>

        <h6 class="casilda name">casilda</h6>
        <p class="speech">Nay, Luiz, respect my principles and cease to torture
            me with vain entreaties.  Henceforth my life is another's.
          </p>

        <h6 class="Luiz name">Luiz</h6>
        <p class="speech">But stay—the present and the future—they are
            another's; but the past—that at least is ours, and none can take
            it from us.  As we may revel in naught else, let us revel in
            that!</p>
